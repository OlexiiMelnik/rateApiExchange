# 💲 currency rate application 💲
 # Project description 👀
The "Currency Rate Application" is a web application designed to retrieve and store currency exchange rates from two APIs: MonoBank and PrivatBank. The application provides a convenient way to manage and utilize these exchange rates for various purposes.

- integration with MonoBank API: The application establishes a connection with the MonoBank API to fetch the latest currency exchange rates. It retrieves rates for various currencies against the Ukrainian hryvnia (UAH);

- integration with PrivatBank API: The application also interacts with the PrivatBank API to obtain currency exchange rates. This integration allows for a broader range of currency options and provides more flexibility in rate comparison and analysis;

- permanent Storage: The retrieved exchange rates are stored persistently in a database, ensuring that historical data is preserved for future reference and analysis. The storage mechanism enables efficient retrieval and management of exchange rate information;
